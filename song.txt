The falling leaves
Drift by the window
The autumn leaves 
Of red and gold
I see your lips
The summer kisses
The sunburned hands
I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song

but i miss you
most of all 
my darling
when autumn leaves
start to fall

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
but i miss you
most of all 
my darling
when autumn leaves
start to fall...
